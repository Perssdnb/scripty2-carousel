              <div class="pro-caption">Ballpark is a great new way of sending estimates and invoices online, and we’re proud to say that it’s our very own creation.  We built Ballpark to focus on simple communication - something that seemed to be lost on so many of the current invoicing apps out there, who would sooner pile on features than think of how they’d affect the experience. Built for businesses of all sizes, Ballpark helps teams keep track of their estimates and invoices, work collaboratively, and feel more organized by centralizing all their email threads into one coherent conversation.

With that rampant use comes not only a sense of classic-addict guilt, but an insatiable sense of responsible opportunity as well. The result was Fluid, a free Tumblr theme we designed that anyone can use - it’s our way of giving back to the community that we enjoy so very much.</div>
